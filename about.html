  <h1>A little bit about me</h1>
  <p>My name is Lars Ørnlo. I currently reside in Vestfold, Norway.<br />

    <ul>
      <li>Development</li>
      <li>Cloud Infrastructure</li>
      <li>Support consultant (2nd line)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Cloud Infrastructure is mostly Office 365 and Microsoft Azure. See <a href="/certifications/">Certifications</a>
    for my main areas.
    Development is done with various languages, which includes but is not limited to the following:
